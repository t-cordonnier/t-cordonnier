- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Cordonnier
- 👀 I’m interested in free/libre/opensource software and computer-assisted translation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on OmegaT
- 📫 How to reach me ...

I maintain the project Silvestris: http://www.silvestris-lab.org/ containing a set of tools related to computer assisted translation (i.e. software for _human_ translators)
Indeed, most of my projects are not in GitHub but self-hosted, in particular in the forge of Silvestris project: http://forge.silvestris-lab.org/ (no authentication required to access projects or repositories, only to make changes!)
